        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
            The chatbot uses Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, to serve the web pages and handle server-side logic. It communicates with the OpenAI API to process and generate responses based on the user's input.

        <h2>Security and Data</h2>
        <p>
            User privacy is paramount. The chatbot keeps track of IP addresses only for connection counts. No chat content is saved beyond the current session, ensuring user data remains confidential.
